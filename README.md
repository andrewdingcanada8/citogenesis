**Project Idea(s):**
### Idea 1: LunchDate

Meeting up with friends in college is hard. Grabbing a meal together can be even harder. Scheduling conflicts, differing price sensitivity and the dizzying amount of choices. Enter LunchDate. The socially driven lunch group organizer that helps you find people to eat by showing you people’s availability and allowing for users to send invitations. The best part? You even get a discount for bringing a large group of people to the restaurants. Students can receive discounts if their group size is 3 or above, generating large amounts of traffic for restaurants everywhere.

**Critical Features for MF**

**User login**
Users would have to log-in in order to modify their data and group options. This is an important feature because of privacy and security reasons. We wouldn’t want users to be able to change the friends and lunch groups of other users.

This may be a hard implementation because it would require us to implement some kind of secure login system. We are not quite sure how to make this section yet. I am predicting that we’d need to implement some form of SQL database with all usernames and passwords, as well as some form of encryption on the front and backend so that passwords are never stored as plain textfiles.


**User and restaurant profile database**
In order to keep track of the lunch dates, the app must know what users there are, and which one of them are in a “lunch date” together at what restaurant.

Edge cases like accessing the same profile on multiple browsers might be hard to deal with. We must also address

We would also need to keep track of each user’s entire group of friends and make sure the friendship goes both ways.

*R*estaurant Browsing and Discounts**
Users would need to be able to see exactly what restaurants are available and what discounts they have. My friend Jake tells me that though Snackpass offers discounts as well, it’s not always super visible which restaurants are doing promotions.

This section is very frontend heavy, and we would need to incorporate many javascript elements to allow for custom clickable buttons, image galleries and live updates on the status of restaurants.

*QR code generation for restaurants to verify group date for discount*
Restaurants will need to verify the validity of a group’s lunchdate by scanning a qr code on a user’s app. This QR code will need to be generated by us and scanned to confirm the validity. We want this feature because restaurants we’ve talked to have shown scepticism in the app because they think they can be “scammed” by customers who “claim” they are using the app and will give out unnecessary discounts.

This section will be hard because there will be cryptography elements to the algorithm for generating a scannable QR code. We will also need to use some form of API for scanning and decoding QR codes once we’ve generated them.

*Bells and Whistles*
*User availability and discovery*
Users will be able to discover which of their friends is able to eat at what time.

This may be hard because it requires storing each user’s availability periods and finding intersects with the user’s friends. There will also need to be an algorithm to find the best times of the week to eat given a selected number of friends.
